vampire sunlight damage works even at night and under trees and still keeps going if you die


Well you should be able to use abilities not on the ground Ruins some abilities like poison beam
Instead of 3 active abilities you should do 2 active and 1 passive
It’s more interesting and 3 abilities can be overwhelming
More easier to code anyways so it’s a win win
Particles of abilities are kind of unclear
Like I was just using my abilities and not knowing if it hit you or not
Plus not satisfying to us








shadow bind center particle doesnt get removed

IMPORTANT:
Intangible bulwark barrier wall doesnt make a barrier.
get rid of dream walker and replace it with another class



BALANCE CHANGES:
vampire turn vampire ability needs to make the turned unable to go in sunlight
diminutive enchanter size changes cause you to go full hp when transforming and when turning back
poison domain needs to be bigg by 3x
paradoxical envoy cube needs to last a lot less active time
lightning strike, speed force and time slow cooldowns need to be reduces
speed class needs permanent speed 2 instead of speed 1
